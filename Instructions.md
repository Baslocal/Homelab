# Homelab Design Considerations

## Isolation

* Each service with a web console should ideally be running in its own virtual machine (VM) or Linux container (LXC container) for better isolation and security. This helps prevent conflicts between services and improves stability.
* If you choose to stack multiple services in a single VM or container for resource efficiency, ensure that they don't use the same default ports (e.g., HTTPS: 443). You'll need to configure different ports for each service to avoid conflicts.

## Resource Allocation

* Assigning the appropriate amount of CPU, memory, and storage resources to each service is crucial for optimal performance. Over-provisioning resources can be wasteful, while under-provisioning can lead to bottlenecks and slowdowns. Consider the expected workload of each service when allocating resources.

## Platform Compatibility

* This script has been tested on both Debian and Ubuntu distributions. Functionality on other distributions may vary. If you're using a different distribution, consult the script's documentation or community resources for compatibility information and any necessary adjustments.

**Please note:** These are general guidelines. The specific configuration for your Homelab will depend on your unique needs and resources.

**Additional Considerations**

* **Security:** Always prioritize security in your Homelab. Implement firewalls, access controls, and keep software up-to-date.
* **Scalability:** Plan for future growth by choosing solutions that can easily scale up or down based on your needs.
* **Data Backup:** Regularly back up your important data to prevent loss in case of hardware failure or accidental deletion.

**Quick Start Commands**

**Installing Dependencies (Debian/Ubuntu)**

If you don't have `sudo` or `curl` installed, use these commands to install them:

```bash
# Check and install sudo if not present
if ! command -v sudo &> /dev/null; then
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y sudo
fi

# Check and install curl if not present
if ! command -v curl &> /dev/null; then
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y curl
fi
