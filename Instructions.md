# Homelab Design Considerations

## Isolation

* Each service with a web console should ideally be running in its own VM or LXC container.
* If you stack multiple services in a single VM or container, ensure that the default ports (e.g., HTTPS 443) are not the same for all services.

## Resource Allocation

* Allocating the appropriate amount of resources to each service can significantly impact overall deployment and performance.

## Platform Compatibility 

* This script has been tested on both Debian and Ubuntu distributions.

**Paste this into the terminal:**




#Quick start command 
# Check and install sudo if not present 
if ! command -v sudo &> /dev/null; then
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y sudo
fi

# Check and install curl if not present
if ! command -v curl &> /dev/null; then
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y curl
fi

# Download the script
sudo curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Baslocal/Homelab/main/actionpak.sh > actionpak.sh

# Make the script executable
sudo chmod +x actionpak.sh

# Run the script
sudo ./actionpak.sh
