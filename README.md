## A Note from the Creator

Thanks for checking out my Homelab -ActionPak- script. I've put this together 
to help with setting up various tools in a homelab environment. Before you dive in, please 
keep in mind:

1. This script is intended for homelab use, not production environments.
2. Take a moment to review the script before running it.
3. If possible, test it in a safe environment first.
4. Always keep backups of your important data.
5. The applications installed by this script belong to their respective owners, not me.
6. While I've tested this script in my own setup, I can't guarantee it'll work the same in 
   every environment.
7. I can't take responsibility for any issues that might occur in your system.

Feel free to use, modify, or share this script as you see fit. If you find issues or have 
ideas for improvements, I'd love to hear them!

By using this script, you acknowledge that you're doing so at your own risk and
